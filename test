Thank you for looking into this.

The issue with Jupyter kernels failing in VS Code on my Azure Virtual Desktop is now resolved by running VS Code in Administrator mode.

From a cloud engineering perspective, this is a functional workaround, but it is not ideal because:

Running developer tools in admin mode increases security exposure.

It bypasses principle of least privilege best practices.

It may affect extension updates and profile isolation in the long term.

I will proceed with this workaround for now, but I recommend considering a profile/FSLogix permissions review so that Jupyter can run under a nonâ€‘admin user in the future.

Thank you for your assistance.
